I'm Jean-Pierre De Jesus DIAZ, a software engineer based in Spain with a
passion for systems programming and open source.

Most of my work revolves around **Rust** and low-level systems software. I
enjoy building tools that interact closely with the operating system. I find
satisfaction in writing code that is both correct and efficient.

I'm also drawn to **GNU Guix** and reproducible systems. I maintain several
Guix package definitions and channel repositories, including packages for the
Raspberry Pi, TeamSpeak, and formal verification tools.

More recently I've been exploring **Snap packaging** and **Ubuntu Core** for
lightweight, single-purpose machines. For example, I run a small virtual machine
built on Ubuntu Core that keeps a dynamic DNS record updated so my friends and I
can play games together on dedicated servers.

Beyond that, I have a broad curiosity that has led me to tinker with formal
verification, embedded operating systems, blockchain protocols, and GPU
computing at various points.

When I'm not writing code, I enjoy learning about how things work under the
hood, whether that's a Linux subsystem, a compiler toolchain, or a new
programming language.
